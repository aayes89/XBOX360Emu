# XBOX360Emu
Java PPC emulator for Xbox 360. <b>Actively in development</b><br>
For those who say it's not possible, the intention is to complete this emulator in a language uncommon for these purposes and then port it to other supported platforms (Android, Web, etc.).<br>
It's necessary to thoroughly debug each set of instructions so that the interpretation is 100% correct, using a modular, scalable, and best-practice style (in most cases).

# Implemented
* Display and Framebuffer support with OpenGL (JOGL)
* MemoryDevice and RAM
* CPU (supporting most instructions and opcodes )
* Files (ELF32, ELF64 and RAW)

# TO DO
* Controllers (joystick support)
* SMC support
* NAND support
* Hard disk and USB management
* Improve coding to make it cleaner and more debuggable
